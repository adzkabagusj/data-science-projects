## 📂 Featured Projects

### 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP)
*   **Sentiment Analysis of LLM Chatbot Applications**: A robust pipeline using an ensemble of **XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost** alongside transformer-based features to classify user sentiment in highly imbalanced datasets.
*   **Count Verdict Analysis & Sentence Prediction**: Analyzing legal documents to predict case outcomes and sentencing using advanced text mining and classification techniques.

### 👁️ Computer Vision
*   **Crowd Counting & Density Estimation**: Implementation of state-of-the-art deep learning models to estimate person counts and generate density maps in high-crowd scenarios.
*   **Human Fall Detection & Action Recognition**: A real-time safety application designed to detect falls and recognize specific human actions from video data.
*   **Multi-Task Clothing Attribute Classification**: Simultaneously classifying multiple clothing attributes (color, type, style) using a unified deep learning architecture.

### 📈 Predictive Modeling & Time Series
*   **Multi-Regional Food Price Prediction**: Leveraging **Ensemble Learning** to forecast food price fluctuations across various geographical regions.
*   **PM2.5 Air Quality Prediction**: Evaluating the impact of meteorological data on Particulate Matter (PM2.5) prediction using tree-based regression models.
